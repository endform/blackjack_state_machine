This is a little demo of how you can use state_machine to write simple
interactive applications. Included in the repo is Blackjack_state_machine.png
which is a graph that represents the machine with all states and events.

The main loop is pleasingly concise. Each state offers a command method that
causes the program to advance the underlying state and return a symbol for
the next even that should fire. The different agents, the dealer and the
player classes, have methods on them which sometimes compute the next event
programatically but some require user input.

The tests are under the spec folder.
